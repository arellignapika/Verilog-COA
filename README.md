# Verilog-COA
This repository contains Verilog code for designing and simulating digital circuits. It includes modules for combinational and sequential logic, such as logic gates, multiplexers, flip-flops, and state machines, with testbenches for verification. Ideal for learning and implementing core digital design concepts.
